Lift Validation Project
=======================

The purpose of this project is to perform client side validation and server side validation with the same logic.  Specifically, when a user hits the submit button, the fields are validated on the server side.  However, if validation fails on any of the fields, feedback is presented to the user.  This project uses Bootstrap Feedback and Tooltips for field validation.
